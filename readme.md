# How to create a smart switch for an electric boiler to save money

My electric water heater consumes a lot of electricity, and it does so at times when it is most expensive. This is because I have dynamic prices which change every hour and I shower at an expensive time. And even if a had a high&low tariff, the problem would still exist.

There is more than one way to solve this problem, and I prefer one that is technological in nature.

# Solution? A smart switch!

Because I already have flexible rates for my electric car, I need to stick to that. This forces the solution to be a smart switch. This switch will only power the electric water heater when electricity is relatively cheap.

# The big picture
